the stucture of explicit scheme seems clear
the linear parts seem ok
the nonlinear term requires some work:
1. for explicit scheme, it is okay: I need to update matrix inside time step (with proper assembling, I am still not sure about how to do it). both PDSolver and implicitMHD need some work.
2. for nonlinear problem, how could link nonlinear term properly??

move back to MFEM

>>>plot solutions at each time step (see ex16)
first open a glvis as a server in another terminal
then run the program; it should plot results auto

I believe I could use FE solver by providing the right hand side in two updates

Then I could built right side separatedly
