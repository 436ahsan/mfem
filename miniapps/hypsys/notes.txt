DEBUG
   -some methods and apps don't work when finer resolved (e.g. in time)
   -mass error for swe for example
   ./hypsys -p 3 -c 2 -vs 100 -tf 0.004 -s 1 -dt 0.001 -m data/wall-bdr-4segment.mesh -r 0 -o 2 -e 1
      -> There should not be a mass error for dam break with land bdrs!
      -> It seems to be the limited DG fluxes.
      -> In 1D they should equal the high order ones - which they are not.

next steps

If possible: try to make advection with non-constant velocity and MCL work

minor tasks:
   -C++ type cleanup, e.g for DofInfo classes
   -Maybe move stuff thats not needed within main routines (e.g. dofs) into fe_evol.cpp
   -If difficult, move bound computation to MCL Evolution.
   -Remove all MFEM_ABORTS in repeated switches
   -Use either tensor product formula for PrecGrad or Dmitris result for triangles
   -Use mfem::Mult for matrix multiplication
   -Using  extremely high order is not feasable, probably due to inexact mass matrix inversion.
   -Since MCL works only for elements with constant Jacobians, maybe use Vector of size ne
   -Restructure galerkin, fe_evol and mcl (constructors)
   -Euler: Implement subsonic in- and outflow.
   -Change final time by modifying it in the apps/*.cpp files (for non steady examples or generally if it makes sense).
   -visualization of other unknowns / quotients of unknowns, vector valued unknowns


future tasks
   -Once different evolution schemes are considered, check combinations of schemes: e.g. DG0 only for standard evolution.
