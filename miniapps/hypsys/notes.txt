   Minor Tasks
      advection.cpp TODOs

   High Priority:
      Cleanup
      Efficiency

   Medium Priority:
      TODO either set tFinal in each configuration, or remove from Configuration struct
      Advection - NodalQuadRule
      DerivedQuantities - do it properly, not just with Bernstein coefficients

   Low Priority:
      Test GMS for Euler, remove if unnecessary
      Try to run  MCL on curved geometries

   Desirable:
      Expression for momentum in narrowing channel
      Sedov setup
      Euler missing boundary conditions


next steps
   -Pressure fix

If possible: try to make advection with non-constant velocity and MCL work

minor tasks:
   -C++ type cleanup, e.g for DofInfo classes
   -Maybe move stuff thats not needed within main routines (e.g. dofs) into fe_evol.cpp
   -If difficult, move bound computation to MCL Evolution.
   -Remove all MFEM_ABORTS in repeated switches
   -Use mfem::Mult for matrix multiplication
   -Since MCL works only for elements with constant Jacobians, maybe use Vector of size ne
   -Restructure galerkin, fe_evol and mcl (constructors)
   -Euler: Implement subsonic in- and outflow.
   -Change final time by modifying it in the apps/*.cpp files (for non steady examples or generally if it makes sense).
   -visualization of other unknowns / quotients of unknowns, vector valued unknowns
