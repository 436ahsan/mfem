ATTENTION


next steps


minor tasks:
   -Euler: Implement subsonic in- and outflow.
   -Change final time by modifying it in the apps/*.cpp files (for non steady examples or generally if it makes sense).
   -visualization of other unknowns / quotients of unknowns, vector valued unknowns


future tasks
   -Once different evolution schemes are considered, check combinations of schemes: e.g. DG0 only for standard evolution.
