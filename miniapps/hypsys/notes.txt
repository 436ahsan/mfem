HypSyS NOTES

TODO:
-Euler: Implement subsonic in- and outflow.
-option to use rescaling in glvis.
-figure out a good way to avoid ifs/switches within the evolution - if possible let each scheme inherit from (p)fe_evol classes
-visualization of other unknowns / quotients of unknowns, vector valued unknowns (Priority 4)

Current state:
-Solves Advection, Burgers, KPP, Shallow Water, and Euler.
-DG0 supported, fully MPI parallelized.

Next major tasks:
-Entropy Stability
-Low order IDP schemes
   * Once different evolution schemes are considered, check combinations of schemes: e.g. DG0 only for standard evolution.
-Limiting
