next steps


If possible: try to make advection with non-constant velocity and MCL work

minor tasks:
   -Use mfem::Mult for matrix multiplication
   -Using  extremely high order is not feasable, probably due to inexact mass matrix inversion.
   -Since MCL works only for elements with constant Jacobians, maybe use Vector of size ne
   -Restructure galerkin, fe_evol and mcl (constructors)
   -Euler: Implement subsonic in- and outflow.
   -Change final time by modifying it in the apps/*.cpp files (for non steady examples or generally if it makes sense).
   -visualization of other unknowns / quotients of unknowns, vector valued unknowns


future tasks
   -Once different evolution schemes are considered, check combinations of schemes: e.g. DG0 only for standard evolution.
