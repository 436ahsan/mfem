TODO
   Minor Tasks
      Check if it is actually possible to make Gresho vortex converge to steady state (with galerkin first)
      Check apps/bl.cpp for correctness
      Pick a MoST gimmick problem - get rid of it in burgers, ...

   High Priority:
      Discrepancy to results in paper :( - already in 1D low order method, Woodward-Colella breaks
      Cleanup
      Efficiency

   Medium Priority:
      TODO either set tFinal in each configuration, or remove from Configuration struct
      Advection - NodalQuadRule

   Low Priority:
      Test GMS for Euler, remove if unnecessary
      Try to run  MCL on curved geometries

   Desirable:
      -Euler: Implement subsonic in- and outflow.
      -Sedov setup
      -Theoretically, double-mach requires a subsonic outlet at the short edge before wall boundaries
      -Noh problem: zero verlocity part of bdr: wall, rest: supersonic outflow (east, north)
         and supersonic inflow (south, east), i.e.  bdr type changes in time
      -Expression for momentum in narrowing channel


next steps
   -Pressure fix: Required for Woodward-Colella, double-mach, Sedov, Noh, (MoST)

If possible: try to make advection with non-constant velocity and MCL work

minor tasks:
   -C++ type cleanup, e.g for DofInfo classes
   -Maybe move stuff thats not needed within main routines (e.g. dofs) into fe_evol.cpp
   -If difficult, move bound computation to MCL Evolution.
   -Remove all MFEM_ABORTS in repeated switches
   -Use mfem::Mult for matrix multiplication
   -Since MCL works only for elements with constant Jacobians, maybe use Vector of size ne
   -Restructure galerkin, fe_evol and mcl (constructors


future tasks
   -Entropy fixes
   -Smoothness indicator
