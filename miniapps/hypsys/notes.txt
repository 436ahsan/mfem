ATTENTION

DEBUG
   ((- Blowup / negative water height))
   (- Bar states seem not to lie between u_i and u_j -> GMS)
   - Dip in front of rarefaction wave is too big
   - Some resolutions produce unphysical results
      * Galerkin solution can be recovered if all terms are used in antidiffusive fluxes
      * Disable limiting - Use unlimited fluxes and check which terms are necessary
      * Without dij it works but is diffusive
   Probelm seems to be a non-sequential limiting strategy


next steps

If possible: try to make advection with non-constant velocity and MCL work

minor tasks:
   -C++ type cleanup, e.g for DofInfo classes
   -Maybe move stuff thats not needed within main routines (e.g. dofs) into fe_evol.cpp
   -If difficult, move bound computation to MCL Evolution.
   -Remove all MFEM_ABORTS in repeated switches
   -Use either tensor product formula for PrecGrad or Dmitris result for triangles
   -Use mfem::Mult for matrix multiplication
   -Using  extremely high order is not feasable, probably due to inexact mass matrix inversion.
   -Since MCL works only for elements with constant Jacobians, maybe use Vector of size ne
   -Restructure galerkin, fe_evol and mcl (constructors)
   -Euler: Implement subsonic in- and outflow.
   -Change final time by modifying it in the apps/*.cpp files (for non steady examples or generally if it makes sense).
   -visualization of other unknowns / quotients of unknowns, vector valued unknowns


future tasks
   -Once different evolution schemes are considered, check combinations of schemes: e.g. DG0 only for standard evolution.
