HypSyS NOTES

TODO:
-Euler: Implement subsonic in- and outflow.
-option to use rescaling in glvis.
-Change final time by modifying it in the apps/*.cpp files (for non steady examples or generally if it makes sense).
-visualization of other unknowns / quotients of unknowns, vector valued unknowns

Current state:
-Solves Advection, Burgers, KPP, Shallow Water, and Euler.
-DG0 supported, fully MPI parallelized.

Next major tasks - Stabilization
-Low order IDP schemes
   * Once different evolution schemes are considered, check combinations of schemes: e.g. DG0 only for standard evolution.
-Limiting
-Entropy Stability
