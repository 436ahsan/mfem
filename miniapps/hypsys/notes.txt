HypSyS NOTES

TODO:
-minor: consistent: return values in (scalar) hyperbolic sytsems, check switch statements, make these consistent
-make sure the appropriate bdr conditions are used (Priority 1)
   For systems of equations use physical bdr conditions and Riemann solver - distinction between types of bdr conditions?
-figure out a good way to avoid ifs/switches within the evolution - if possible let each scheme inherit from (p)fe_evol classes (Priority 2)
-clean up hypsys.cpp and phypsys.cpp, try to move as much functionality into the apps-constructors as possible (Priority 3)
-visualization of other unknowns / quotients of unknowns, vector valued unknowns (Priority 4)
-find a good way to set global parameters (GravConst in SWE, gamma in Euler) (Priority 5)


Current state:
-Solves Advection, Burgers, KPP, Shallow Water, and Euler.
-DG0 supported, fully MPI parallelized.
-Only inflow and periodic boundary conditions are supported.

Next major tasks:
-Low order IDP schemes
   * Once different evolution schemes are considered, check combinations of schemes: e.g. DG0 only for standard evolution.
-Limiting
-Entropy Stability
