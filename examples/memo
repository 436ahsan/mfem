this is useful (basic classes):
http://mfem.org/code-overview/#mesh

bilinear form (very helpful!)
http://mfem.org/bilininteg/

some thing I need:
CalcDivShape (probably not, unless we use some fancy space)
CalcDShape
CalcShape

There is already a wrapper to KINSOL. Will that be enough if we add our own preconditioner? Or it is better to implement our own. We probably cannot use the multigrid in the algorithm.

ex2 is a basic linear elasticity example: H1 or NURBS elements; How to add boundary as an extra degree of freedoms; 
ex5 is a saddle point problem: visit output (very easy)

ex19.cpp
ex19 -m ../data/beam-quad.mesh
glvis -m deform.mesh -g pressure.sol
glvis -m deform.mesh -g deformation.sol

H1_FECollection lin_coll(order-1, dim); 
should dim=1??: No, here is just define a scalar value

should read ex2 ex5 and ex10

ex2.cpp
Do not know static condensation
this problem requires two boundary attibutes in the mesh (come with the grid generator)

This part is not clear (boundary condition)
   ess_bdr = 0;
   ess_bdr[0] = 1;
   fespace->GetEssentialTrueDofs(ess_bdr, ess_tdof_list);

I think the boundary condition may not be the same as it claims
